        <h4>
        All six hundred pony school students are here
      And we intend to serve them 6 candies each.  <br>
     How many candies altogether are we going to serve them?</h4>
      
       <p> We can add 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + ...until we add it  600 times. But that will take forever to calculate. 
           And we can easily make mistakes along the line. <br>
There is a trick however to solving multiplication problems. But first we must learn to multiply numbers
from zero to ten. With that knowledge we may then multiply more complex numbers.</p>

        For this purpose, we have to visit the alien space station where we can learn
