        <h1>What is multiplication</h1>
        <h4>Multiplication means "repeated addition"</h4>
        <p>
           Lets take two multiplied by three. <br>
           this simply means that we need to add number two three times. <br>
           And three multiplied by five, will mean we need to add number 
           three five times 
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            two multiply by three can also be written as 2 * 3 <br>
            and this can in turn be written as 3 * 2. <br>
            This is because 2 * 3 will give us the same answer as 3 * 2.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
            <br> and <br>
            3 * 5 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15.
